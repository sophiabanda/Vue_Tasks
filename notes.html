<!-- Notes -->
 
<!-- Adding scoped param to styles scopes those styles exculisvely 
  to the component that it's in, even if there is an element by 
  the same name -->

  <!-- Setup keyword in Script makes for less boilerplate when making the 
  component -->

  <!-- ref is imported from vue and is how we define reactive state values -->
 <!-- This is known as an SFC, single file component since the script,
  template and styles are all in this component -->

  <!-- In order to bind the input to the state variable use v-model-->

<!-- To add a DOM event to an element you can use the @ sign.  
  If you want to reference the current value of the form, you need to
  append .value. The state variable is essentially an object wrapper around
  a primitive. Prevent default action by appending .prevent on submit action -->

  <!-- Preferred way in vue to pass state up is to emit an event -->

<!-- Build into vue is a v-if directive! Anytime you want an attribute 
 to have an expression inside of it, or reference state variables you must use a colon.
 It otherwise will register as a string -->

<!-- Vue has built in directive called v-for that iterates over an array or object for you!-->
